            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>There are two things required in a miracle,
<note place="margin"> Two conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a thing to make it a miracle.</note> firſt that the cauſe be an hidden cauſe altogether, I ſay, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; for if it be hid to ſome &amp; knowne to others, then it is not a miracle: example, when a country man ſeeth the eclipſe of the Sunne, the cauſe of it is hid to him, yet becauſe it is not hid from a Mathematician, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not a miracle. Againe, theſe things that are miracles were not appointed by God in the creation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26595:9"/> to receive theſe effects which he worketh immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them: the ſetling of the earth upon nothing is not a miracle in the ſecond reſpect, becauſe here he worketh according to nature, placing it in the Center. When Chriſt reſtored ſight to the blinde, this was a miracle becauſe it was not according to Gods ordinary courſe in nature; but when they ſaw once, their ſight could not be called a miraculous ſight but naturall, for they ſaw as wee ſee; ſo wee may ſay, the ſettling of the earth <hi>in prima conſtitutione</hi> is miraculous, <hi>ſed conſtituta,</hi> being once ſetled according to nature, it is not miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. God is ſayd to ſet a Law to his creatures and to command them, he doth this by naturall cauſes:
<note place="margin"> Before the creation God did things by his immediate power, but nature being ſetled he workes by it.</note> when nature was not in the firſt creation he did things by his immediate power, but nature being once ſetled he doth things mediately, neither doth this diminiſh any thing from the power of God, when he worketh by his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid nature, for if he ſhould binde the ſea onely by his power, then we ſhould ſee nothing but onely, his power to prayſe him for it; but when he doth theſe things by naturall meanes, here we are led both to prayſe his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and his power.</p>
               <p>God when he created the earth,
<note place="margin"> Why the Lord made hils and valleyes.</note> hee made in ſome places hils and in ſome places emptie parts to containe the water; but to reduce this inequalitie to an equalitie, <hi>he weigheth</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith <hi>cap.</hi> 40.12.) <hi>the hils in ballances,</hi> and maketh this hill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyſe that, and from this equall diſtribution of the parts ſetling one againſt another,
<note place="margin"> The Lord weighed the parts of the earth.</note> he ſetled the earth in the midſt that it is not moved, &amp; leſt it ſhould fal no way but to the Center, he made it firme in the loweſt parts, and leſt one part ſhould fall upon another, he provided that the hils ſhould be poiſed one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The earth that is the Center is ſo ſetled that it cannot
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:26595:10"/> be moved; there falleth out ſome particular earth-quakes here and there,
<note place="margin"> The whole earth is not ſhaken with earth-quake.</note> but the whole earth is never ſhaken with an earth-quake: for if the whole were ſhaken at once, with an earth-quake, then it ſhould follow that the earth were ſetled contrarie to the nature of it; for the nature of the Center, is to be Immoveable: and if it could be ſo, then the heavens were turned about that which is moveable.

               <p>ALthough the water be ſaid to be under the earth, yet the water as the lighteſt element is above the earth.</p>
               <p>The water is above the earth, therefore <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is called <hi>umbilicus terrae, Ezek.</hi> 38.12. <hi>The midſt of the Land;</hi> and <hi>Tyrus</hi> is ſayd to be placed in the <hi>heart of the Sea, Ezch.</hi> 28.8. The water is ſayd to have a heart, and the earth a Navell; as the heart is above the Navell, ſo the water naturally is above the earth.</p>
               <p>When God created the Waters and the earth, at the firſt they were mixed together as the Wine and the dregs, but the Lord ſeparated them, and hee cauſed the earth to fall downe like the dregges of the wine, and the water to riſe out of the earth to the circumference,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:26595:12"/> then he gathered the waters into one place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the deepe; whereby the earth and the water, made but one globe, and the earth, being ſetled as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the water goeth round about it, as the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; therefore that poſition of the Philoſophers holds not, that there is ten times more water than earth, for as <hi>Bodinus</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Theatrum naturale,</hi> that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hill being meaſured perpendicularly to the ſuperfice of the water, is not a mile of height about the water, and the deepeſt place in the ocean is not a mile of deepth;
<note place="margin"> There is not ſo much water as earth.</note> therefore there is not ſo much water as there is earth, and if the earth were made in a plaine circumference it would fill up all the waſtneſſe of the deepes, and in <hi>Noahs</hi> deludge it was but fifteene cubites above the higheſt mountaine, therefore there would not bee ſo much water as earth.</p>
               <p>The earth being the Center and the water the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
<note place="margin"> The earth and the water make but one globe.</note> they make but one Globe which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the eclipſe of the Moone, for when ſhe is eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is but one ſhadow caſt up both of the water and the earth upon the body of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>By the Eclipſe wee learne foure great ſecrets in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, firſt the diſtance of the earth from the Sunne;
<note place="margin"> Foure great ſecrets to be learned from the eclipſe.</note> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the diſtance of the earth from the Moone; thirdly, the diſtance of the Sunne from the Moone; and fourthly, that the water and the earth make but one Globe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the diſcance of the earth from the Sunne, for the Sunne is farther removed from us than the Moone, as we may perceive by the Eclipſe; when the ſhadow is caſt upward from the Sunne, it reacheth to the body of the Moone, and by meaſuring the ſhadow, we know the bigneſſe of the Sunne, the circumference of the earth, and the bigneſſe of the Moone, and that the Sunne is bigger than the earth, and the earth bigger than the Moone.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:26595:13"/>
               <p>That the Sun is bigger than the earth,
<note place="margin"> The Sunne is bigger than the earth.</note> the forme of the ſhadow ſheweth this, for it caſteth up the ſhadow to the Moone <hi>Pyramidaliter inſtar coni,</hi> and if the Sunne were not bigger than the earth, then the ſhadow would riſe up like a pillar in infinitum, and then all the planets ſhould be Eclipſed as well as the Moone.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin"> How to know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Moone from the earth.</note> by the ſhadow in the Eclipſe wee gather the diſtance of the Moone from the earth, for the earth Eclipſeth no other planet than the Moone, and meaſure the length of the ſhadow, and then it will ſhew what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the Moone is from us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin"> How to know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Moone from the Sunne.</note> by the Eclipſe of the Sunne wee may know the diſtance of the Sunne from the Moone, for the Sunne can never be totally eclipſed, becauſe it is both higher and bigger than the Moone; and knowing the bigneſſe of the bodie of the Moone; wee may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what diſtance there is betwixt the Sunne and the Moone by the parts of the earth that are obſcured in the Eclipſe, for the eclipſe of the Sunne is never uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall as that of the Moone, for there may bee an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipſe in <hi>Perſia</hi> or <hi>Iudea</hi> which is not here, &amp; here when it is not there. So meaſuring the parts of the earth eclipſed, and the bigneſſe of the ſhadow of it, wee may gather the height of the Sunne above the Moone.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing is,
<note place="margin"> The water and the earth make but one globe</note> that the water and the earth make but one Globe, becauſe the ſhadow is but one ſhadow, as the ſhadow of the Moone caſt downe in the Eclipſe of the Sunne is but one ſhadow; but if the water and the earth were two diſtinct Globes, then they would caſt two ſhadowes.</p>

<note place="margin"> Weight and levitie doe change according to the midſt.</note> for they vary much changing the midſt; example: take a maſſe of pure gold, and a maſſe of that which is mixed gold, and weigh them both firſt in the ayre with a paire of ballances, and then they are of equall weight, but ſinke them both in the ballance halfe a foote deepe in the water, then the mixed gold ſhall be found much more heavier in the water than it was in the ayre: the reaſon of this is the poroſitie, the ballance is onely the judge of the weight of things and reduceth them to one qualitie, but they being ſuncke in the water, the water judgeth of their qualitie, which is the lighter, and which is the weightier, the water tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that but by accident onely, by the poroſitie of the mettall, but the ballance trieth it <hi>per ſe,</hi> for the water entring into the impure mettall, becauſe of the poroſitie of it maketh it deſcend downeward, and the pure met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall having no pores in it retaineth ſtill the ſame weight which it had in the ayre; and thus the mixture or mixed mettall varieth according to the midſt here, the water. The ayre is ſeene ſometimes going up, and ſometimes going downe, and wee know not which is the proper Center of it, untill it enter into the hollow places of the earth, and then it burſteth upward, and then wee know that the Center of it is above here, and the earth is the midſt or judge to trie this, as the water was to try the pure mettall from the impure. When the pure mettall and the mixed mettall are in the water, to know how much the one is better than the other, adde to the mixed gold in the water a peece of pure gold, and ſo make the ballance of equall weight in the water, and that addition put to the mixed gold in the water will ſhew you the difference betwixt the pure gold and the mixed gold, here we ſee, <hi>mutato medio mutatur pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> the midſt being changed, the weight is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:26595:19"/>
               <p>If ye weigh 21 pounds of Lead in the ayre, and ſo much gold of equall weight, and ſincke the ballance in the water, the gold ſhall bee but ſeventeene pound weight and the lead ſhall be one and twentie; the reaſon of this is the poroſitie of the lead which ſinketh in the water: ſo weigh thirtie one ounces of ſilver in the ayre, and thirtie one ounces of gold, and put them in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the gold ſhall be thirtie one ſtill, but the ſilver will be thirtie ſix.

               </p>
               <p>The winde is an exhalation which is more groſſe than the pure and ſubtile ayre, but more ſubtile than the groſſe exhalations which come out of the earth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the winde for the ſubtilitie of it, aſcendeth to the loweſt religion of the ayre the clouds, but it is carried downe by the weight of it from the more pure and cleare region of the ayre, yet it cannot deſcend to the earth, becauſe of the thicke and groſſe vapours w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ariſe out of the earth ſtill, for they muſt bee loweſt, and it cannot aſcend through the more ſubtile ayre, for the lighteſt muſt alwayes be higheſt, and having no place to reſt in, it is carried about, and carrieth about the clouds with it; therefore the weight which God made to the winde was this, to varie according to the midſt, for compare the winde with the groſſer exhalations of the earth, then it is light, but compare it againe with the pure and ſubtile ayre, then it is heavie: ſo weight and levitie in the winde are onely in compariſon.

               <p>The Lord to ſhew the nature of the wicked and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Iewes, borroweth a compariſon from the mettals, ſilver and lead: for as the ſilver-ſmith before he melts the ſilver,
<note place="margin"> Why the Lord borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this compariſon from the ſilverſmith.</note> hee putteth lead to it, to make it melt the better; ſo the Lord threatned firſt the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious wicked Iewes, to ſee if by them hee might draw hypocirtes (who held themſelves to be good ſilver) to repentance and to melt.</p>
               <p>The mettals are bred by the heat of the Sunne, and then by cold they grow together, and are conſolidated: although they be conſolidated by cold, yet they are not bred by cold,
<note place="margin"> How the mettals are bred.</note> but by the heate of the Sunne. If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidating or gathering of them together were the cauſe of their being, then the melting of them ſhould cauſe them to periſh: the heat of the Sunne, drawing up the vapors and exhalations, is the firſt cauſe of engendering the mettalls, and then commeth the cold and conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateth them; for as the Meteors are bred in the ayre, of vapors and exhalations drawne up into the ayre out of the earth, ſo are mettals bred in the earth of theſe exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations drawne up by the Sunne, but hindered and kept
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26595:24"/> within the earth, that they cannot aſcend any higher; then they congeale and conſolidate about the ſtones or ſome other parts of the earth, therefore they are called <hi>metalla, id eſt,</hi>

               <p>The mettals generally are of a watrie ſubſtance, and all of them have leſſe or more water in them; all the mettals can melt in the fire, and the fire being removed they conſolidate againe, which ſheweth us that they are of a watrie ſubſtance and participateth both of water and earth. The mettals when they are melted by the fire, they are not like Iee, for when the Ice is frozen it is ſtill but water, and is capable of no other forme; but the mettals beſides that they can be melted, they receive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formes, which the Ice cannot receive, being ſtill water and not mettall. Stones may be broken, and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; ſometimes they may be hewed, but they cannot be melted as the mettalls. Yron, braſſe, and Lead, have more earth in them, than the gold or ſilver, as we may perceive by the ruſt which they contract: gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have more free of earth than other mettals are, and they are more decocted water than the reſt.

               <p>Now let us make a compariſon betwixt gold and lead, Gold hath leſſe earth, and more water in it than lead, yet it is heavier than lead, becauſe it hath no pores in it, to let in the ayre as lead hath; yet it melteth not ſo ſoone as the Lead doth,
<note place="margin"> Why the gold melteth not ſo ſoone as the Lead doth.</note> becauſe the water is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixed in the gold, than in the Lead, and the gold being more ſolide keepeth the watrie element better than the lead doth.</p>
               <p>Then let us compare lead and ſilver together, lead hath more earth in it than ſilver hath, and the water floweth ſooner out of it than out of the ſilver, becauſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:26595:25"/> it is not ſo ſolide; it hath more earth in it then ſilver hath, and therefore it is hotter when it is melted than ſilver, and it melteth ſooner than ſilver, becauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not ſo perfectly mixed in it as in ſilver;
<note place="margin"> Why Lead is put to ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in melting.</note> therefore the ſilver Smith when he would melt ſilver putteth lead to it, to cauſe it to melt the ſooner, and this the Latines call <hi>replumbare argentum</hi> to leaden the ſilver.</p>
               <p>The application of the compariſon is this,
<note place="margin"> The applieation of the compariſon.</note> that the hypocriticall Iewes are like yron and ſteele, and not like ſilver as they would appeare; for they are ſo farre from ſeparating themſelves from the wicked, that they are altogether like Iron and ſteele that can hardly melt: <hi>the bellowes are burnt,</hi> that is, the Prophet hath ſpent his travell in vaine amongſt them, and the moſt notorious wicked men a mongſt them are like the lead which is burnt up; yet hypocrites by their example will not melt, but remain indurate and as hard hearted as before, therefore they are but <hi>reprobate ſilver,</hi> and the Lord ſhall reject them.</p>
               <p>When the Lord commeth to his Church to ſeparate droſſe from the ſilver,
<note place="margin"> God findeth few that are good ſilver.</note> he ſcarcely getteth the third part as good ſilver. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.8.9. <hi>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as ſilver is refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi> happy are theſe who are of this little handfull and of this third part, but as for the wicked he will put them away out of the earth like droſſe,

               <p>The ſecond thing,

               <p>There is a great reſemblance betwixt our birth and our death,

<note place="margin"> God and nature maketh nothing in vaine.</note> doe nothing in vaine. Why hath God put wine in the grape but that men ſhould drinke it? and why doth he put milke in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breaſts? but onely that the children ſhould ſucke it;
<note place="margin"> Two reaſons why God placed the dugges of a woman in her breaſt.</note> God hath placed the dugges of a woman in her breſt, and the pappes of a beaſt in her belly, and they give a double reaſon of this, firſt a phyſicall reaſon and then a morall reaſon; the phyſicall reaſon is this, hee hath placed the dugges of a woman ſo neere the heart and Liver, that the milke might be the better concocted for the nouriſhing of the child: <hi>mulieri ſuperius adpect us naſcuntur ubera ut in promptu fit oſculari, amplecti, &amp; fove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re infantem,</hi> that is, The dugges of a woman are placed in her breſt,
<note place="margin"> A forcible argument to move children to obey their mothers when they have given them ſucke.</note> that ſhe may more readily kiſſe, embrace and cheriſh her infant. In old times it was holden to be one of the moſt forcible obligations to bind the child
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:26595:40"/> to obey the mother, becauſe ſhe had given him ſucke, and therefore the mothers would atteſt their children this wayes, <hi>By theſe dugges which thou haſt ſuckt doe this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The milke of the mother is the fitteſt mike to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the child, for as <hi>contraria contrarijs curantur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin"> The mothers milke is the fitteſt milke for the childs complexion.</note> ſo <hi>ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia ſimilibus aluntur,</hi> the blood which was firſt the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baicator</hi> ſhould now be the <hi>Altor</hi> when it is turned into mike, this milke muſt be fitter for the <hi>Childes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion than any other milke.
<note place="margin"> The milke a forcible meanes to make the child reſemble the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The milke is a forcible meane to make the child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her whom he ſucketh: <hi>Gellius</hi> giveth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, take a kid &amp; let it ſucke an ewe; the haire of it will become like unto wooll: take a lambe againe, and let it ſucke a goate, the wooll of it will become like the goates haire: ſo let a whelpe ſucke a cat, and he will kill Rats and mice as a cat; ye ſee then what force is in the milke. The hiſtorie giveth this reaſon why <hi>Tiberius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was ſuch a drunkard, becauſe he ſuck't a drunken nurſe; <hi>Caligula</hi> ſucked a cruell nurſe who rubb'd her dugges with blood every day, and therefore he became a cruell and bloody monſter. It is true that good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and inſtruction, but above all, grace can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule theſe inclinations. <hi>Cyrus</hi> before God changed his name, was called <hi>Spacon,</hi> as ye would ſay, a dog,
<note place="margin"> Many have beene eroull by reaſon of the milke they have ſucked.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſuck't a bitch when he was a child; but the Lord gave him excellent and heroicall vertues, and made him the deliverer of his people: theſe vertues over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled his naturall inclinations which would have beene both wilde and curriſh, if theſe vertues had not reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him. <hi>Menahem, Act.</hi> 13.1.

               <p>As the nouriſhing of the child is a great cauſe why the child reſembleth the mother, ſo it is a great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to move the mother to love the child the better: therefore the Church raviſhed with the love of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>O that thou were as my brother that ſucked the breſt of my mother!
